# 🚀 Akhila Muthyala - Portfolio

## 📌 Overview

https://amuthyal.github.io/my-portfolio/

This is my personal **portfolio website** showcasing my work, experience, projects, and technologies I’ve been working with. The website is built with **React** and styled using modern **CSS techniques** to ensure responsiveness across all devices.

It is currently **hosted on GitHub Pages** and will later be deployed on **AWS S3 + CloudFront** for improved performance and scalability.

I've used brittanychiang.com for design inspiration to build my personal website from scratch.
